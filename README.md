# NBA League Average TS% progression

This is a simple plot of the league average true-shooting percentage (TS%), a measure of scoring efficiency which 
factors in the added value of three-point shots and benefits players that are able to create more free throw 
opportunities for themselves.

Over the past 20 years, the offensive principles of the league have changed drastically. This plot shows the effects
of the explosion of three-point attempts over the past few years as a result of the Golden State Warriors' revolutionary
offensive system, as well as the "dark ages" of efficiency in the early to mid aughts when many teams sought to create
as many isolation opportunities as they could on offense.
